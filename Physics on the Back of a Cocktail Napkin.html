However,  on Fridays I like to shoot pool and eat pizza at the local sports bar.  Since happy hour starts at three, I sometimes need to move work down  the street. I was working out how to win a serious game of nine ball  when one of those geeky discussions broke out about pool table physics.  Pool, like many sports, is dominated by the laws of physics. Good players  have an excellent sense of the application of force, the physics of  collisions, and the influence of friction on objects in motion. Last month  I described how friction could be used to increase the realism of the  physics model in real-time games. The demo program made it possible  to see how various coefficients affected a mass-and-spring model. However,  it wasn't very much fun. In order to demonstrate how a solid physical  foundation can actually create interesting game play, I need to pull  some of these concepts together into a real application. A pool table  simulation is a natural choice. It will allow me to apply many of the  techniques I have covered as well as provide some ideas that can be  converted easily to other sports such as golf or tennis.                                                                                 Like  most things in life, pool provides an excellent venue for a physics lesson.     Two  Ball, Corner Pocket                                                                                 Table  1. A summary of the  notation used in this article.     In order  to understand pool, I need to understand collisions between billiard  balls. Fortunately, billiard balls are all spheres of equal size and  weight. That makes the collision calculations a bit easier. Let me begin  by looking at the frictionless case. I suspect that if I ignore the  ball's rotation and do not consider friction, the ball collision will  behave exactly like a particle at the ball's center of mass. That would  be great, as I could use the code from a previous column. However, I  want to make sure. Figure 1 shows a typical collision.  Ball A  is moving at a speed of 20 feet per second and collides with ball B  at a 40 degree angle. In order to determine the velocity of each ball  after the collision, I need to apply dynamics. A collision between two  rigid bodies, which occurs in a very short time and during which the  two bodies exert relatively large forces on each other, is called an  impact. The force between these two bodies during the collision is called  an impulsive force, which is symbolized by j. The common normal to the  surfaces of the bodies in contact is called the line of collision, represented  as n in Figure 1.                                                                                 Figure  1. A simple collision between two billiard balls.      The first  step is to break the initial velocity of ball A into its components  along the line of collision, n, and the tangent to the collision, t.                                                                         The impulsive  force acting during the collision is directed along the line of collision.  Therefore, the t component of the velocity of each ball is not changed.                                                                         In order  to determine the new velocity along the line of collision, I need to  look at the impulsive force between the bodies. The impulse acts on  both bodies at the same time. You may remember Newton's third law of  motion, the forces exerted by two particles on each other are equal  in magnitude and opposite in direction. Since  the impulse forces are equal and opposite, momentum is therefore conserved  before and after the collision. Remember that the momentum of a rigid  body is mass times velocity (mv).                                                                         (Eq. 1) This equation  can't be solved without some more information. In my previous article  &quot;Collision  Response: Bouncy, Trouncy, Fun&quot;, I discussed the coefficient  of restitution. This is the scalar value between 0 and 1 relating the  velocities of bodies before and after a collision via the formula:                                                                         (Eq. 2) For this  example, I'm using a coefficient of restitution e of 0.8. I can use  this formula to create a second equation.                                                                         (Eq. 3) Solving  Equations 1 and 3, I get the velocities of the two billiard balls after  the collision.                                                                         In order  to solve this problem in the simulation, I need to derive the impulse  force directly. The impulse force creates a change in momentum of the  two bodies with the following relationship.                                                                         (Eq. 4) These  formulas can be combined with Equation 2 to determine the impulse force  given the relative velocity and the coefficient of restitution.                                                                         (Eq. 5) You can  plug Equation 5 back into the example problem and make sure it works.  Remember that because of Newton's third law, the impulse is equal and  opposite for the two colliding bodies. When you apply Equation 5 to  the B ball, remember to negate it. Those  of you who read Chris Hecker's column on collision response (&quot;Physics,  Part 3: Collision Response,&quot; Behind the Screen, Game Developer,  February/March 1997) will recognize Equation 4 as the impulse equation  for a general body that does not rotate. When we do not consider the  rotation of the billiard balls, they behave exactly like the particles  used in my March 1999 mass-and-spring demo. My suspicion was correct,  and I can use the particle dynamics system as a base for the demo. For many  applications, this would probably be more than enough to get a decent  physical simulation. In fact, I imagine many pool simulations end right  there. This level of simulation is probably sufficient for other games,  such as pinball. However, anyone who has played much pool knows that  this is not the end of the story. The rotation of the ball caused by  the reaction with the table makes a tremendous difference in the realism  of the simulation. Slip  Sliding Away When a  billiard ball is hit with the cue stick, the ball starts moving across  the table. If the ball is struck along its center of mass, the ball  is not initially rotating. However,  soon the ball starts rolling along. Friction between the ball and the  table causes this roll to occur. You can see this situation in Figure  2.  The ball  is traveling with the forward velocity, v. In my article  &quot;The Trials and Tribulations of Tribology&quot; , I discussed  the use of kinetic friction via the Coulomb dry friction model. For  our purposes, I'm going to call this force &quot;sliding friction.&quot;  The force of friction applied to a body sliding over a surface is given  by the following formula:                                                                         (Eq. 6) The friction  force is applied in the direction opposite the velocity. Since this  force is applied to the surface of the ball and not its center of mass,  the frictional force causes angular acceleration in the ball. As the  ball rolls across the table, the angular velocity increases because  of this sliding friction force. This continues until a time of equilibrium  is reached, where the velocity of the point contacting the table equals  the velocity of the center of mass. At this time, the ball is no longer  sliding and is now rolling on the table. This situation is called a  natural roll or rolling without sliding. In mathematical terms, this  situation happens when                                                                         (Eq. 7) where  v is the velocity of the ball, w (LUKE-this is a lowercase omega) is  the angular velocity of the ball, and R is the ball's radius.                                                                                  Figure  2. A billiard ball sliding across the table.     Now I  need to show how the angular acceleration actually changes. This is  going to mean bringing up another term, the inertia tensor, or I. You  may remember from Chris Hecker's column on 3D physics (&quot;Physics,  Part 4: The Third Dimension,&quot; Behind the Screen, June 1997) that  the inertia tensor relates the angular velocity of a body to the angular  momentum of that body. For arbitrarily complex objects, creating the  inertia tensor can be quite difficult. However, for a uniform sphere  where the density is uniform across the sphere, it's quite easy. The  inertia tensor for a sphere is                                                                         (Eq. 8) Therefore,  the product of this matrix with any vector is a simple scaling of that  vector. The relationship between the angular acceleration and the friction  force then becomes                                                                         (Eq. 9) If I now  take a look at the problem in Figure 2, I can calculate how long it  will take for the ball to achieve natural roll given an initial velocity  v. From the principle of impulse and momentum, I know some information  about the linear momentum and angular velocity of the ball at a later  time.                                                                         In other  words, the momentum at some later time is the initial momentum minus  the impulse created by the friction force, f. I know the friction force  from Equation 6.                                                                         At the  point of natural roll, I know the state of equilibrium between angular  and linear velocity from Equation 7.                                                                         So you  can see that as a result of the friction force of the table, a sliding  billiard ball will always reach a point where it is rolling without  sliding on the table. This is the type of realism I want to have in  the simulation. A ball when struck should slide across the table, slowly  settling to a state where it is rolling without slipping.  How  Do I Stop This Crazy Thing? One glaring  problem remains. I can run the simulation with all of the physics discussed  so far. When struck hard, a billiard ball will slide and then roll.  Once the ball has reached this natural roll, there is nothing in my  simulation that will keep it from continuing to roll forever. The friction  force is gone since the point of contact is not moving relative to the  table. I need to add another force that will slow down a rolling ball.  I can add another frictional force, called rolling friction, which is  applied when the ball is in natural roll. The form of rolling friction  is                                                                         It is  applied exactly like the sliding friction whenever the natural roll  conditions apply. It is important to note that the coefficients of rolling  and sliding friction are not necessarily the same. Think of a ball moving  on a rubber surface. The coefficient of sliding friction would be very  high. However, the rolling friction would be comparatively low, allowing  the ball to roll across the surface easily. Bumpin'  the Cush Collision  with the table's side cushions can be handled in a couple of ways. If  I consider the table to be completely 3D, I will need to handle 3D collision  between the ball and the cushion. That would be the most realistic.  It would allow the balls to move up and down as well as side to side.  This might be interesting if I wanted to be able to perform a jump shot  (when the cue ball jumps up and over other balls on the table). However,  I'm not really ready to tackle the physical and interface issues involved  in making this happen.  If I'm  willing to give up the flexibility of allowing the balls to move in  3D, things become a bit easier. For one thing, I can eliminate the gravitational  force acting on the ball. A ball sitting on a table is in a constant  collision battle with the table top. By getting rid of the gravitational  force, I save having to deal with the ball constantly interpenetrating  the table. I still need to keep track of the gravitational force as  it is used in calculating the friction force applied by the table. However,  I just assume the balls are in constant sliding or rolling contact with  the table.  Also,  if I ignore vertical motion of the balls, I can turn the collision with  the side cushions into a 2D computational geometry problem. The boundaries  of the table are now line segments and I can use the 2D collision detection  routines developed in my article &quot;Crashing  into the New Year&quot;. Later,  I may wish to allow the balls to jump. It would then be easy enough  to convert the collision back to 3D. These kinds of decisions are made  all the time during the game production process. Since game simulation  is all about speed versus realism, simplifying the problem if it works  for your particular application makes sense. Rack  'Em Up Using  these techniques, I have created a demonstration of a simple pool table.  The simulation uses rolling and sliding friction to simulate the way  a real billiard ball moves across a table. Collision between balls is  handled through conservation of momentum and the elastic collision model.  There are several areas that still need work. Of course, I didn't talk  about applying &quot;English&quot; to the shot by striking the ball  off the center of mass. This technique is what makes shots such as a  Masse, draw, or topspin possible. This is largely just a matter of where  the impulse from the cue stick is applied. Also, the lack of friction  between colliding balls does not allow effects such as collision-induced  spin.  Another  problem arises when we consider simultaneous collision between several  billiard balls. When calculating the resulting force when two balls  collide, it was fairly easy to determine the resulting force. However,  when several balls collide simultaneously, the law of conservation of  momentum becomes much harder to enforce. In order to calculate the resultant  forces correctly, I need to solve several simultaneous equations. Obviously,  this tends to complicate things quite a bit. Alas,  that will have to wait for another time. Until then, see if you can  modify the source code to handle these effects.

I am generally 
pretty disciplined about working normal hours during the week. However, 
on Fridays I like to shoot pool and eat pizza at the local sports bar. 
Since happy hour starts at three, I sometimes need to move work down 
the street. I was working out how to win a serious game of nine ball 
when one of those geeky discussions broke out about pool table physics. 
Pool, like many sports, is dominated by the laws of physics. Good players 
have an excellent sense of the application of force, the physics of 
collisions, and the influence of friction on objects in motion.
</p>
<p>
Last month 
I described how friction could be used to increase the realism of the 
physics model in real-time games. The demo program made it possible 
to see how various coefficients affected a mass-and-spring model. However, 
it wasn't very much fun. In order to demonstrate how a solid physical 
foundation can actually create interesting game play, I need to pull 
some of these concepts together into a real application. A pool table 
simulation is a natural choice. It will allow me to apply many of the 
techniques I have covered as well as provide some ideas that can be 
converted easily to other sports such as golf or tennis.

In order 
to understand pool, I need to understand collisions between billiard 
balls. Fortunately, billiard balls are all spheres of equal size and 
weight. That makes the collision calculations a bit easier. Let me begin 
by looking at the frictionless case. I suspect that if I ignore the 
ball's rotation and do not consider friction, the ball collision will 
behave exactly like a particle at the ball's center of mass. That would 
be great, as I could use the code from a previous column. However, I 
want to make sure. Figure 1 shows a typical collision.
</p><p>
Ball A 
is moving at a speed of 20 feet per second and collides with ball B 
at a 40 degree angle. In order to determine the velocity of each ball 
after the collision, I need to apply dynamics. A collision between two 
rigid bodies, which occurs in a very short time and during which the 
two bodies exert relatively large forces on each other, is called an 
impact. The force between these two bodies during the collision is called 
an impulsive force, which is symbolized by j. The common normal to the 
surfaces of the bodies in contact is called the line of collision, represented 
as n in Figure 1.

The impulsive 
force acting during the collision is directed along the line of collision. 
Therefore, the t component of the velocity of each ball is not changed.

In order 
to determine the new velocity along the line of collision, I need to 
look at the impulsive force between the bodies. The impulse acts on 
both bodies at the same time. You may remember Newton's third law of 
motion, the forces exerted by two particles on each other are equal 
in magnitude and opposite in direction.
</p>
<p>
Since 
the impulse forces are equal and opposite, momentum is therefore conserved 
before and after the collision. Remember that the momentum of a rigid 
body is mass times velocity (mv).

(Eq. 5)
</p>
<p>
You can 
plug Equation 5 back into the example problem and make sure it works. 
Remember that because of Newton's third law, the impulse is equal and 
opposite for the two colliding bodies. When you apply Equation 5 to 
the B ball, remember to negate it.
</p>
<p>
Those 
of you who read Chris Hecker's column on collision response ("Physics, 
Part 3: Collision Response," Behind the Screen, <em>Game Developer, 
</em>February/March 1997) will recognize Equation 4 as the impulse equation 
for a general body that does not rotate. When we do not consider the 
rotation of the billiard balls, they behave exactly like the particles 
used in my March 1999 mass-and-spring demo. My suspicion was correct, 
and I can use the particle dynamics system as a base for the demo.
</p>
<p>
For many 
applications, this would probably be more than enough to get a decent 
physical simulation. In fact, I imagine many pool simulations end right 
there. This level of simulation is probably sufficient for other games, 
such as pinball. However, anyone who has played much pool knows that 
this is not the end of the story. The rotation of the ball caused by 
the reaction with the table makes a tremendous difference in the realism 
of the simulation.

<strong>Slip

</p>
<p>
When a 
billiard ball is hit with the cue stick, the ball starts moving across 
the table. If the ball is struck along its center of mass, the ball 
is not initially rotating.
</p>
<p>
However, 
soon the ball starts rolling along. Friction between the ball and the 
table causes this roll to occur. You can see this situation in Figure 
2.

The ball 
is traveling with the forward velocity, v. In my article<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3170/the_trials_and_tribulations_of_.php">

the use of kinetic friction via the Coulomb dry friction model. For 
our purposes, I'm going to call this force "sliding friction." 
The force of friction applied to a body sliding over a surface is given 
by the following formula:

(Eq. 6)
</p>
<p>
The friction 
force is applied in the direction opposite the velocity. Since this 
force is applied to the surface of the ball and not its center of mass, 
the frictional force causes angular acceleration in the ball. As the 
ball rolls across the table, the angular velocity increases because 
of this sliding friction force. This continues until a time of equilibrium 
is reached, where the velocity of the point contacting the table equals 
the velocity of the center of mass. At this time, the ball is no longer 
sliding and is now rolling on the table. This situation is called a 
natural roll or rolling without sliding. In mathematical terms, this 
situation happens when

Now I 
need to show how the angular acceleration actually changes. This is 
going to mean bringing up another term, the inertia tensor, or I. You 
may remember from Chris Hecker's column on 3D physics ("Physics, 
Part 4: The Third Dimension," Behind the Screen, June 1997) that 
the inertia tensor relates the angular velocity of a body to the angular 
momentum of that body. For arbitrarily complex objects, creating the 
inertia tensor can be quite difficult. However, for a uniform sphere 
where the density is uniform across the sphere, it's quite easy. The 
inertia tensor for a sphere is

Therefore,

If I now 
take a look at the problem in Figure 2, I can calculate how long it 
will take for the ball to achieve natural roll given an initial velocity 
v. From the principle of impulse and momentum, I know some information 
about the linear momentum and angular velocity of the ball at a later 
time.

So you 
can see that as a result of the friction force of the table, a sliding 
billiard ball will always reach a point where it is rolling without 
sliding on the table. This is the type of realism I want to have in 
the simulation. A ball when struck should slide across the table, slowly 
settling to a state where it is rolling without slipping. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>How 
Do I Stop This Crazy Thing?</strong>
</p>
<p>
One glaring 
problem remains. I can run the simulation with all of the physics discussed 
so far. When struck hard, a billiard ball will slide and then roll. 
Once the ball has reached this natural roll, there is nothing in my 
simulation that will keep it from continuing to roll forever. The friction 
force is gone since the point of contact is not moving relative to the 
table. I need to add another force that will slow down a rolling ball. 
I can add another frictional force, called rolling friction, which is 
applied when the ball is in natural roll. The form of rolling friction 
is

It is 
applied exactly like the sliding friction whenever the natural roll 
conditions apply. It is important to note that the coefficients of rolling 
and sliding friction are not necessarily the same. Think of a ball moving 
on a rubber surface. The coefficient of sliding friction would be very 
high. However, the rolling friction would be comparatively low, allowing 
the ball to roll across the surface easily.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bumpin' 
the Cush</strong>
</p>
<p>
Collision 
with the table's side cushions can be handled in a couple of ways. If 
I consider the table to be completely 3D, I will need to handle 3D collision 
between the ball and the cushion. That would be the most realistic. 
It would allow the balls to move up and down as well as side to side. 
This might be interesting if I wanted to be able to perform a jump shot 
(when the cue ball jumps up and over other balls on the table). However, 
I'm not really ready to tackle the physical and interface issues involved 
in making this happen. 
</p>
<p>
If I'm 
willing to give up the flexibility of allowing the balls to move in 
3D, things become a bit easier. For one thing, I can eliminate the gravitational 
force acting on the ball. A ball sitting on a table is in a constant 
collision battle with the table top. By getting rid of the gravitational 
force, I save having to deal with the ball constantly interpenetrating 
the table. I still need to keep track of the gravitational force as 
it is used in calculating the friction force applied by the table. However, 
I just assume the balls are in constant sliding or rolling contact with 
the table. 
</p>
<p>
Also, 
if I ignore vertical motion of the balls, I can turn the collision with 
the side cushions into a 2D computational geometry problem. The boundaries 
of the table are now line segments and I can use the 2D collision detection 
routines developed in my article <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3429/crashing_into_the_new_year_.php">"Crashing 
into the New Year".</a>
</p>
<p>
Later, 
I may wish to allow the balls to jump. It would then be easy enough 
to convert the collision back to 3D. These kinds of decisions are made 
all the time during the game production process. Since game simulation 
is all about speed versus realism, simplifying the problem if it works 
for your particular application makes sense.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rack 
'Em Up</strong>
</p>
<p>
Using 
these techniques, I have created a demonstration of a simple pool table. 
The simulation uses rolling and sliding friction to simulate the way 
a real billiard ball moves across a table. Collision between balls is 
handled through conservation of momentum and the elastic collision model. 
There are several areas that still need work. Of course, I didn't talk 
about applying "English" to the shot by striking the ball 
off the center of mass. This technique is what makes shots such as a 
Masse, draw, or topspin possible. This is largely just a matter of where 
the impulse from the cue stick is applied. Also, the lack of friction 
between colliding balls does not allow effects such as collision-induced 
spin. 
</p>
<p>
Another 
problem arises when we consider simultaneous collision between several 
billiard balls. When calculating the resulting force when two balls 
collide, it was fairly easy to determine the resulting force. However, 
when several balls collide simultaneously, the law of conservation of 
momentum becomes much harder to enforce. In order to calculate the resultant

However, \non Fridays I like to shoot pool and eat pizza at the local sports bar. \nSince happy hour starts at three, I sometimes need to move work down \nthe street. I was working out how to win a serious game of nine ball \nwhen one of those geeky discussions broke out about pool table physics. \nPool, like many sports, is dominated by the laws of physics. Good players \nhave an excellent sense of the application of force, the physics of \ncollisions, and the influence of friction on objects in motion.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nLast month \nI described how friction could be used to increase the realism of the \nphysics model in real-time games. The demo program made it possible \nto see how various coefficients affected a mass-and-spring model. However, \nit wasn't very much fun. In order to demonstrate how a solid physical \nfoundation can actually create interesting game play, I need to pull \nsome of these concepts together into a real application. A pool table \nsimulation is a natural choice. It will allow me to apply many of the \ntechniques I have covered as well as provide some ideas that can be \nconverted easily to other sports such as golf or tennis.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ctable border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" width=\"55%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"\u003e\n\t\u003ctbody\u003e\n\t\t\u003ctr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003ctd\u003e\n        \u003cpicture\u003e\n        \u003csource  type=\"image/webp\" media=\"(max-width: 576px)\" srcSet='https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt95b381df7c12c15d/blt3f01baa66d114d6c/615e76662cfedd733639bdcf/lander_01.GIF?width=480\u0026quality=80\u0026disable=upscale' /\u003e\n        \u003csource  type=\"image/webp\" media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcSet='https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt95b381df7c12c15d/blt3f01baa66d114d6c/615e76662cfedd733639bdcf/lander_01.GIF?width=768\u0026quality=80\u0026disable=upscale' /\u003e\n        \u003csource  type=\"image/webp\" media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" srcSet='https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt95b381df7c12c15d/blt3f01baa66d114d6c/615e76662cfedd733639bdcf/lander_01.GIF?width=828\u0026quality=80\u0026disable=upscale' /\u003e\n        \u003csource type=\"image/jpeg\" srcSet='https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt95b381df7c12c15d/blt3f01baa66d114d6c/615e76662cfedd733639bdcf/lander_01.GIF?width=828\u0026quality=80\u0026disable=upscale' /\u003e\n        \u003cimg src=\"https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt95b381df7c12c15d/blt3f01baa66d114d6c/615e76662cfedd733639bdcf/lander_01.GIF?width=828\u0026quality=80\u0026disable=upscale\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt3f01baa66d114d6c\" alt=\"lander_01.GIF\" asset_uid=\"blt3f01baa66d114d6c\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"252\" /\u003e\n        \u003c/picture\u003e\n        \u003c/td\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/tr\u003e\n\t\t\u003ctr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003ctd\u003e \n\t\t\t\u003cdiv align=\"center\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cstrong\u003eLike \n\t\t\tmost things in life, pool provides an\u003cbr /\u003e\n\t\t\texcellent venue for a physics lesson.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003c/td\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/tr\u003e\n\t\u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTwo \nBall, Corner Pocket\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ctable border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" width=\"29%\" align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"\u003e\n\t\u003ctbody\u003e\n\t\t\u003ctr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003ctd\u003e\n        \u003cpicture\u003e\n        \u003csource  type=\"image/webp\" media=\"(max-width: 576px)\" srcSet='https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt95b381df7c12c15d/blt4819603e1c0e2e35/615e76692e35f3558b3ab0dc/lander_table_01.GIF?width=480\u0026quality=80\u0026disable=upscale' /\u003e\n        \u003csource  type=\"image/webp\" media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcSet='https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt95b381df7c12c15d/blt4819603e1c0e2e35/615e76692e35f3558b3ab0dc/lander_table_01.GIF?width=768\u0026quality=80\u0026disable=upscale' /\u003e\n        \u003csource  type=\"image/webp\" media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" srcSet='https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt95b381df7c12c15d/blt4819603e1c0e2e35/615e76692e35f3558b3ab0dc/lander_table_01.GIF?width=828\u0026quality=80\u0026disable=upscale' /\u003e\n        \u003csource type=\"image/jpeg\" srcSet='https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt95b381df7c12c15d/blt4819603e1c0e2e35/615e76692e35f3558b3ab0dc/lander_table_01.GIF?width=828\u0026quality=80\u0026disable=upscale' /\u003e\n        \u003cimg src=\"https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt95b381df7c12c15d/blt4819603e1c0e2e35/615e76692e35f3558b3ab0dc/lander_table_01.GIF?width=828\u0026quality=80\u0026disable=upscale\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt4819603e1c0e2e35\" alt=\"lander_table_01.GIF\" asset_uid=\"blt4819603e1c0e2e35\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"324\" /\u003e\n        \u003c/picture\u003e\n        \u003c/td\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/tr\u003e\n\t\t\u003ctr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003ctd\u003e \n\t\t\t\u003cdiv align=\"center\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cstrong\u003eTable \n\t\t\t1.

Fortunately, billiard balls are all spheres of equal size and \nweight. That makes the collision calculations a bit easier. Let me begin \nby looking at the frictionless case. I suspect that if I ignore the \nball's rotation and do not consider friction, the ball collision will \nbehave exactly like a particle at the ball's center of mass. That would \nbe great, as I could use the code from a previous column. However, I \nwant to make sure. Figure 1 shows a typical collision. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nBall A \nis moving at a speed of 20 feet per second and collides with ball B \nat a 40 degree angle. In order to determine the velocity of each ball \nafter the collision, I need to apply dynamics. A collision between two \nrigid bodies, which occurs in a very short time and during which the \ntwo bodies exert relatively large forces on each other, is called an \nimpact. The force between these two bodies during the collision is called \nan impulsive force, which is symbolized by j. The common normal to the \nsurfaces of the bodies in contact is called the line of collision, represented \nas n in Figure 1.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ctable border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" width=\"75%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"\u003e\n\t\u003ctbody\u003e\n\t\t\u003ctr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003ctd\u003e\n        \u003cpicture\u003e\n        \u003csource  type=\"image/webp\" media=\"(max-width: 576px)\" srcSet='https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt95b381df7c12c15d/bltd68410fa484c3e89/615e766bd932354978cb9d80/lander_02.GIF?width=480\u0026quality=80\u0026disable=upscale' /\u003e\n        \u003csource  type=\"image/webp\" media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcSet='https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt95b381df7c12c15d/bltd68410fa484c3e89/615e766bd932354978cb9d80/lander_02.GIF?width=768\u0026quality=80\u0026disable=upscale' /\u003e\n        \u003csource  type=\"image/webp\" media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" srcSet='https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt95b381df7c12c15d/bltd68410fa484c3e89/615e766bd932354978cb9d80/lander_02.GIF?width=828\u0026quality=80\u0026disable=upscale' /\u003e\n        \u003csource type=\"image/jpeg\" srcSet='https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt95b381df7c12c15d/bltd68410fa484c3e89/615e766bd932354978cb9d80/lander_02.GIF?width=828\u0026quality=80\u0026disable=upscale' /\u003e\n        \u003cimg src=\"https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt95b381df7c12c15d/bltd68410fa484c3e89/615e766bd932354978cb9d80/lander_02.GIF?width=828\u0026quality=80\u0026disable=upscale\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltd68410fa484c3e89\" alt=\"lander_02.GIF\" asset_uid=\"bltd68410fa484c3e89\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"243\" /\u003e\n        \u003c/picture\u003e\n        \u003c/td\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/tr\u003e\n\t\t\u003ctr\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003ctd\u003e \n\t\t\t\u003cdiv align=\"center\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cstrong\u003eFigure \n\t\t\t1.

Since this \nforce is applied to the surface of the ball and not its center of mass, \nthe frictional force causes angular acceleration in the ball. As the \nball rolls across the table, the angular velocity increases because \nof this sliding friction force. This continues until a time of equilibrium \nis reached, where the velocity of the point contacting the table equals \nthe velocity of the center of mass. At this time, the ball is no longer \nsliding and is now rolling on the table. This situation is called a \nnatural roll or rolling without sliding.

I can run the simulation with all of the physics discussed \nso far. When struck hard, a billiard ball will slide and then roll. \nOnce the ball has reached this natural roll, there is nothing in my \nsimulation that will keep it from continuing to roll forever.

However,  on Fridays I like to shoot pool and eat pizza at the local sports bar.  Since happy hour starts at three, I sometimes need to move work down  the street. I was working out how to win a serious game of nine ball  when one of those geeky discussions broke out about pool table physics.  Pool, like many sports, is dominated by the laws of physics. Good players  have an excellent sense of the application of force, the physics of  collisions, and the influence of friction on objects in motion. Last month  I described how friction could be used to increase the realism of the  physics model in real-time games. The demo program made it possible  to see how various coefficients affected a mass-and-spring model. However,  it wasn't very much fun. In order to demonstrate how a solid physical  foundation can actually create interesting game play, I need to pull  some of these concepts together into a real application. A pool table  simulation is a natural choice. It will allow me to apply many of the  techniques I have covered as well as provide some ideas that can be  converted easily to other sports such as golf or tennis.                                                                                 Like  most things in life, pool provides an excellent venue for a physics lesson.     Two  Ball, Corner Pocket                                                                                 Table  1. A summary of the  notation used in this article.     In order  to understand pool, I need to understand collisions between billiard  balls. Fortunately, billiard balls are all spheres of equal size and  weight. That makes the collision calculations a bit easier. Let me begin  by looking at the frictionless case. I suspect that if I ignore the  ball's rotation and do not consider friction, the ball collision will  behave exactly like a particle at the ball's center of mass. That would  be great, as I could use the code from a previous column. However, I  want to make sure. Figure 1 shows a typical collision.  Ball A  is moving at a speed of 20 feet per second and collides with ball B  at a 40 degree angle. In order to determine the velocity of each ball  after the collision, I need to apply dynamics. A collision between two  rigid bodies, which occurs in a very short time and during which the  two bodies exert relatively large forces on each other, is called an  impact. The force between these two bodies during the collision is called  an impulsive force, which is symbolized by j. The common normal to the  surfaces of the bodies in contact is called the line of collision, represented  as n in Figure 1.                                                                                 Figure  1. A simple collision between two billiard balls.      The first  step is to break the initial velocity of ball A into its components  along the line of collision, n, and the tangent to the collision, t.                                                                         The impulsive  force acting during the collision is directed along the line of collision.  Therefore, the t component of the velocity of each ball is not changed.                                                                         In order  to determine the new velocity along the line of collision, I need to  look at the impulsive force between the bodies. The impulse acts on  both bodies at the same time. You may remember Newton's third law of  motion, the forces exerted by two particles on each other are equal  in magnitude and opposite in direction. Since  the impulse forces are equal and opposite, momentum is therefore conserved  before and after the collision. Remember that the momentum of a rigid  body is mass times velocity (mv).                                                                         (Eq. 1) This equation  can't be solved without some more information. In my previous article  \u0026quot;Collision  Response: Bouncy, Trouncy, Fun\u0026quot;, I discussed the coefficient  of restitution. This is the scalar value between 0 and 1 relating the  velocities of bodies before and after a collision via the formula:                                                                         (Eq. 2) For this  example, I'm using a coefficient of restitution e of 0.8. I can use  this formula to create a second equation.                                                                         (Eq. 3) Solving  Equations 1 and 3, I get the velocities of the two billiard balls after  the collision.                                                                         In order  to solve this problem in the simulation, I need to derive the impulse  force directly. The impulse force creates a change in momentum of the  two bodies with the following relationship.                                                                         (Eq. 4) These  formulas can be combined with Equation 2 to determine the impulse force  given the relative velocity and the coefficient of restitution.                                                                         (Eq. 5) You can  plug Equation 5 back into the example problem and make sure it works.  Remember that because of Newton's third law, the impulse is equal and  opposite for the two colliding bodies. When you apply Equation 5 to  the B ball, remember to negate it. Those  of you who read Chris Hecker's column on collision response (\u0026quot;Physics,  Part 3: Collision Response,\u0026quot; Behind the Screen, Game Developer,  February/March 1997) will recognize Equation 4 as the impulse equation  for a general body that does not rotate. When we do not consider the  rotation of the billiard balls, they behave exactly like the particles  used in my March 1999 mass-and-spring demo. My suspicion was correct,  and I can use the particle dynamics system as a base for the demo. For many  applications, this would probably be more than enough to get a decent  physical simulation. In fact, I imagine many pool simulations end right  there. This level of simulation is probably sufficient for other games,  such as pinball. However, anyone who has played much pool knows that  this is not the end of the story. The rotation of the ball caused by  the reaction with the table makes a tremendous difference in the realism  of the simulation. Slip  Sliding Away When a  billiard ball is hit with the cue stick, the ball starts moving across  the table. If the ball is struck along its center of mass, the ball  is not initially rotating. However,  soon the ball starts rolling along. Friction between the ball and the  table causes this roll to occur. You can see this situation in Figure  2.  The ball  is traveling with the forward velocity, v. In my article  \u0026quot;The Trials and Tribulations of Tribology\u0026quot; , I discussed  the use of kinetic friction via the Coulomb dry friction model. For  our purposes, I'm going to call this force \u0026quot;sliding friction.\u0026quot;  The force of friction applied to a body sliding over a surface is given  by the following formula:                                                                         (Eq. 6) The friction  force is applied in the direction opposite the velocity. Since this  force is applied to the surface of the ball and not its center of mass,  the frictional force causes angular acceleration in the ball. As the  ball rolls across the table, the angular velocity increases because  of this sliding friction force. This continues until a time of equilibrium  is reached, where the velocity of the point contacting the table equals  the velocity of the center of mass. At this time, the ball is no longer  sliding and is now rolling on the table. This situation is called a  natural roll or rolling without sliding. In mathematical terms, this  situation happens when                                                                         (Eq. 7) where  v is the velocity of the ball, w (LUKE-this is a lowercase omega) is  the angular velocity of the ball, and R is the ball's radius.                                                                                  Figure  2. A billiard ball sliding across the table.     Now I  need to show how the angular acceleration actually changes. This is  going to mean bringing up another term, the inertia tensor, or I. You  may remember from Chris Hecker's column on 3D physics (\u0026quot;Physics,  Part 4: The Third Dimension,\u0026quot; Behind the Screen, June 1997) that  the inertia tensor relates the angular velocity of a body to the angular  momentum of that body. For arbitrarily complex objects, creating the  inertia tensor can be quite difficult. However, for a uniform sphere  where the density is uniform across the sphere, it's quite easy. The  inertia tensor for a sphere is                                                                         (Eq. 8) Therefore,  the product of this matrix with any vector is a simple scaling of that  vector. The relationship between the angular acceleration and the friction  force then becomes                                                                         (Eq. 9) If I now  take a look at the problem in Figure 2, I can calculate how long it  will take for the ball to achieve natural roll given an initial velocity  v. From the principle of impulse and momentum, I know some information  about the linear momentum and angular velocity of the ball at a later  time.                                                                         In other  words, the momentum at some later time is the initial momentum minus  the impulse created by the friction force, f. I know the friction force  from Equation 6.                                                                         At the  point of natural roll, I know the state of equilibrium between angular  and linear velocity from Equation 7.                                                                         So you  can see that as a result of the friction force of the table, a sliding  billiard ball will always reach a point where it is rolling without  sliding on the table. This is the type of realism I want to have in  the simulation. A ball when struck should slide across the table, slowly  settling to a state where it is rolling without slipping.  How  Do I Stop This Crazy Thing? One glaring  problem remains. I can run the simulation with all of the physics discussed  so far. When struck hard, a billiard ball will slide and then roll.  Once the ball has reached this natural roll, there is nothing in my  simulation that will keep it from continuing to roll forever. The friction  force is gone since the point of contact is not moving relative to the  table. I need to add another force that will slow down a rolling ball.  I can add another frictional force, called rolling friction, which is  applied when the ball is in natural roll. The form of rolling friction  is                                                                         It is  applied exactly like the sliding friction whenever the natural roll  conditions apply. It is important to note that the coefficients of rolling  and sliding friction are not necessarily the same. Think of a ball moving  on a rubber surface. The coefficient of sliding friction would be very  high. However, the rolling friction would be comparatively low, allowing  the ball to roll across the surface easily. Bumpin'  the Cush Collision  with the table's side cushions can be handled in a couple of ways. If  I consider the table to be completely 3D, I will need to handle 3D collision  between the ball and the cushion. That would be the most realistic.  It would allow the balls to move up and down as well as side to side.  This might be interesting if I wanted to be able to perform a jump shot  (when the cue ball jumps up and over other balls on the table). However,  I'm not really ready to tackle the physical and interface issues involved  in making this happen.  If I'm  willing to give up the flexibility of allowing the balls to move in  3D, things become a bit easier. For one thing, I can eliminate the gravitational  force acting on the ball. A ball sitting on a table is in a constant  collision battle with the table top. By getting rid of the gravitational  force, I save having to deal with the ball constantly interpenetrating  the table. I still need to keep track of the gravitational force as  it is used in calculating the friction force applied by the table. However,  I just assume the balls are in constant sliding or rolling contact with  the table.  Also,  if I ignore vertical motion of the balls, I can turn the collision with  the side cushions into a 2D computational geometry problem. The boundaries  of the table are now line segments and I can use the 2D collision detection  routines developed in my article \u0026quot;Crashing  into the New Year\u0026quot;. Later,  I may wish to allow the balls to jump. It would then be easy enough  to convert the collision back to 3D. These kinds of decisions are made  all the time during the game production process. Since game simulation  is all about speed versus realism, simplifying the problem if it works  for your particular application makes sense. Rack  'Em Up Using  these techniques, I have created a demonstration of a simple pool table.  The simulation uses rolling and sliding friction to simulate the way  a real billiard ball moves across a table. Collision between balls is  handled through conservation of momentum and the elastic collision model.  There are several areas that still need work. Of course, I didn't talk  about applying \u0026quot;English\u0026quot; to the shot by striking the ball  off the center of mass. This technique is what makes shots such as a  Masse, draw, or topspin possible. This is largely just a matter of where  the impulse from the cue stick is applied. Also, the lack of friction  between colliding balls does not allow effects such as collision-induced  spin.  Another  problem arises when we consider simultaneous collision between several  billiard balls. When calculating the resulting force when two balls  collide, it was fairly easy to determine the resulting force. However,  when several balls collide simultaneously, the law of conservation of  momentum becomes much harder to enforce. In order to calculate the resultant  forces correctly, I need to solve several simultaneous equations. Obviously,  this tends to complicate things quite a bit. Alas,  that will have to wait for another time. Until then, see if you can  modify the source code to handle these effects.
